# NLP_jobfraud
I recently worked on analyzing a dataset from Kaggle containing job postings to identify fraudulent job listings. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn, I created a robust pipeline to preprocess the data, engineer features, and train machine learning models for classification.

Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using appropriate strategies.
Combined relevant text columns to create a comprehensive feature set.

2️⃣ Text Processing Techniques:

Utilized NLP tools like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal.
Applied CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.

3️⃣ Machine Learning Models:

Trained models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine for classification tasks.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4️⃣ Deep Learning Approach:

Implemented a neural network using Keras for binary classification.
Utilized techniques like batch training for efficiency and accuracy.
I achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the models in detecting fraudulent job postings.

I'm thrilled about the insights gained from this project and how it contributes to combating online fraud. Looking forward to exploring more data-driven challenges and making a positive impact with AI!
